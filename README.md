# NHL Scores

A quick little python script I wrote for getting current NHL scores.

# Usage

In the `NHL-Scores.py` file you can set up multiple games with the `games` variable.

Example: `games = [['New Jersey', 'Tampa Bay'], ['NY Rangers', 'Ottawa'], ['Minnesota', 'Nashville']]`

The team names must match the team names displayed  on [http://www.nhl.com/ice/scores.htm](http://www.nhl.com/ice/scores.htm)

# Requirements

BeautifulSoup is required. To install it run `pip install beautifulsoup4`
